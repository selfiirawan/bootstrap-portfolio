# Capstone Project 2 – Portfolio Website

This project is my second **Capstone Project**, where I designed and built a personal portfolio website to showcase my projects, skills, and progress as a developer.
A front-end–only project focused on layout, responsiveness, and UI design, without back-end features.

The goal of this project was to create a clean, responsive, and professional-looking portfolio that represents my work and learning journey so far.
